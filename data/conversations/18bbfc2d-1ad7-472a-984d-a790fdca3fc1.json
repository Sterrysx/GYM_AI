Here\u2019s what we need to focus on this week:\n\n### Nutrition:\n- **Calorie Deficit:** Aim for a slight deficit of around 200-300 calories per day. Focus on lean proteins and veggies to support muscle growth.\n- **Protein Intake:** Ensure you\u2019re getting at least 1.6g/kg of protein daily to help build and maintain muscle mass.\n\n### Training:\n- **Strength Training:** Incorporate more compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses to boost muscle gain.\n- **Cardio:** Include one HIIT session this week to bump up your calorie burn without sacrificing muscle. Keep the duration around 20 minutes.\n\n### Lifestyle:\n- **Steps & Activity:** Increase steps gradually to at least 7000 per day. You can achieve this by taking short walks throughout the day.\n- **Sleep:** Your sleep is good, but try to maintain consistency in your bedtime routine for better recovery.\n\nYou\u2019re doing great! Let\u2019s push through and get those numbers where you want them. Keep up the hard work! \ud83d\udcaa",
